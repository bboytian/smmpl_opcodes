============

Contains files important to the lidar laptop

Notes
-----

When running smmpl_opcodes via git bash

- rsync/rsync.exe and sed/sed.exe is to be stored in /usr/bin/
  when git bash is activated, together with the other built in
  bash commands.

  - params references to the commands can simply be the name
    of the command

- .bash* is to be stored in C:/Users/mpluser/

But this is unnecessary now that the executables are included
in the package. Might have to be updated if they become
incompatible with the windows OS
